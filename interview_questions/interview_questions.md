#### what has been your most significant achievement in the last year?

```
Part of my role at ME was to support the Business Continuity Program that makes sure the bank is ready to recover in the event of a crisis. We needed to integrate the 'Business Impact Analysis' into the Governance Risk and Compliance system the bank had purchased. A BIA or Business Impact Analysis identifies the people, systems, and resources required to recover Business Critical Processes.

I facilitated workshops to identify the business requirements for the BIA's, then completed the development and testing before sending communications to relevant stakeholders and providing with training so they could use the new tool.

Each Business Unit's critical processes were signed off by the executive. Gaps between Business and IT expectations around system recovery were identified as part of APRA's CPS 232 Business Continuity Management regulation.

During one release of functionality to our Governance Risk and Compliance system we were making significant changes to the user experience and what users would see when they opened the application.
