My name is Josh, I'm an analyst and an expert at teaching people to understand and extract insights from technology. I help people to embrace change and new collaborative ways of working, to see data as a valuable asset that can be used to create opportunities, capitalise on trends and guide decision making. At the end of the day, I ask the right questions and help people find innovative ways to solve problems that save them time or money.

Most recently I've worked for ME Bank as a Business Analyst and Systems Administrator: They are a small bank dedicated to improving the financial literacy of Australians and providing them with simple low-cost products. I was responsible for ensuring Business Continuity artifacts were up to date and available during a crisis. Facilitating training, managing user access and releasing system enhancements for the Banks Governance Risk and Compliance System. Reviewing Operational Risk and Compliance Incidents and identify and reporting trends or issues that occurred throughout the Bank.

I've also worked for Monash University providing IT support services to Monash staff and students, Kingston City Council who support the elderly to live at home, and IBM who provide innovative technology solutions to governments and companies.

My strengths are: Problem Solving, Resourcefulness and my work ethic.

I am currently exploring opportunities in the area of data science as I am passionate about collaboration and believe that reproducibility is extremely important.
