My name is Josh, I'm an analyst and an expert at teaching people to understand and extract insights from technology. I help people to embrace change and new collaborative ways of working, to see data as a valuable asset that can be used to create opportunities, capitalise on trends and guide decision making. At the end of the day, I ask the right questions and help people find innovative ways to solve problems that save them time or money.

Most recently I've worked for ME Bank as a Business Most recently I've worked for ME; a small bank dedicated to improving the financial literacy of Australians and to provide simple low cost products. I've worked as a Systems Administrator and Business Analyst where I was responsible for making sure Business Continuity artifacts were up to date and available during a crisis. I've Facilitated training, sessions, managed user access and released system enhancements for the Banks Governance Risk and Compliance System. and finally I've reviewed risk and compliance incidents to identify and and report on trends occurring at ME.

I've also worked for Monash University providing IT support services to Monash staff and students, Kingston City Council who support the elderly to live at home, and IBM who provide innovative technology solutions to governments and companies.

My key strengths are: Problem Solving, Resourcefulness and work ethic. I've found I do my best work under pressure, faced with a challenging learning experience.
One achievement I'm proud of is coaching IBM executives in the use of IBM Connections and Twitter. As a result executives increased their confidence, reach and ability to influence others and generate discussion.

I am currently exploring opportunities in the area of data science as I am passionate about new technologies, collaboration and the importance of reproducing analysis.
